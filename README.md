# Payment Processing System 

## Overview

This system handles payment processing for transactions involving sensitive data, securely storing and managing payment information through AWS services like KMS (Key Management Service), DynamoDB, and Lambda functions. The system includes features such as tokenization, ledger creation, audit trail, and payment status tracking for successful and pending transactions.

## Payment Flow Overview

### 1. **Create Ledger Entry for Payment Initiation (PAYMENT-INITIATED)**

- The `persist_payment_ledger` function creates an entry in the `PaymentLedger` DynamoDB table to record the transaction details.
- Key information recorded:
  - **TransactionID**: Unique identifier for the transaction.
  - **SecureToken**: Tokenized payment information.
  - **Amount**: The transaction amount.
  - **ProcessorID**: Identifies the payment processor (e.g., Elavon).
  - **Status**: Set to `PAYMENT-INITIATED` to mark the start of the transaction.

#### Outcome
- The `PaymentLedger` stores a record of the payment with the status `PAYMENT-INITIATED`.

### 2. **Create Security Token (for processor 'Elavon')**

- The security token (`SecureToken`) is encrypted using AWS KMS inside the `encrypt_token` function.
- This encryption ensures that sensitive payment data is securely protected before being passed to the payment processor.
- The encrypted token is used by the processor (Elavon) to authorize the payment request.

### 3. **Create Ledger Entry for Payment Pending (PAYMENT-PENDING)**

- After the payment request is initiated but not yet completed, the payment status is updated in the `PaymentLedger` table to `PAYMENT-PENDING`.
- This reflects that the payment is still being processed by the payment processor.

#### Outcome
- The `PaymentLedger` entry updates with the status `PAYMENT-PENDING`.

### 4. **Payment Intent (Processor 'Elavon') Payment Success**

- Once Elavon processes the payment, it communicates the outcome (success or failure).
- If the payment is successful, the payment status is updated to `PAYMENT-SUCCESS`.

#### Outcome
- The `persist_payment_ledger` function updates the `PaymentLedger` table with the new status `PAYMENT-SUCCESS`.

### 5. **Create Ledger Entry for Payment Success**

- After a successful payment, a new ledger entry is created to reflect the payment success.
- The entry updates the `PaymentLedger` table with the final payment status.

### 6. **Create Audit Trail for Successful Payment**

- The `persist_payment_audit_trail` function creates an audit trail entry for the payment transaction.
- The audit logs query details and the response from the payment processor (Elavon).
- Both the query details and response are encrypted before being stored in the `DynamoDB_AUDIT_TABLE`.

#### Outcome
- The audit log is created in the `DynamoDB_AUDIT_TABLE` with encrypted query details and response information.

### 7. **Normalize Processor Response**

- After the payment success or failure, the system normalizes the response from the payment processor.
- The normalization includes:
  - Updating payment status in the `PaymentLedger`.
  - Logging the success or failure outcome.

### 8. **Success Response to API**

- After the payment is successfully processed, the system returns a success response to the API, completing the payment flow.

## Functions and Operations

### `encrypt_token` Function
- **Purpose**: Encrypts the SecureToken using AWS KMS.
- **Returns**: Encrypted token (Base64-encoded string).

### `persist_payment_ledger` Function
- **Purpose**: Stores payment details (TransactionID, SecureToken, Amount, ProcessorID, Status) in the `PaymentLedger` DynamoDB table.
- **Called**: When a payment is initiated, updated to pending, or confirmed successful.

### `persist_payment_audit_trail` Function
- **Purpose**: Logs an audit trail for each payment transaction.
- **Returns**: A log of the encrypted query and response details.

## Key Components

- **DynamoDB Tables**:
  - `PaymentLedger`: Stores transaction details and statuses.
  - `DynamoDB_AUDIT_TABLE`: Stores audit logs for transaction-related queries and responses.

- **AWS KMS**: Used for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data (SecureToken).
- **AWS Lambda**: Processes payment flow, encrypts data, updates ledger, and logs audit trails.

---

## Error Handling

- Each function is equipped with error handling to ensure that if any issues occur during the payment process, they are logged and returned with relevant error messages.

---

## Environment Variables

- **PAYMENT_KMS_KEY_ARN**: ARN of the KMS key used for encryption.
- **DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME**: Name of the DynamoDB table for PaymentLedger.
- **DYNAMODB_AUDIT_TABLE_NAME**: Name of the DynamoDB table for audit logs.

## Conclusion

This payment processing system provides a secure and efficient flow for handling payment transactions. It ensures data security through tokenization and encryption, tracks payment statuses in a ledger, and logs audit trails for transparency and compliance.
